# SimpleAES
A simple AES encryption and decryption implementation

This is a very simple AES-256 implementation. We can do encrypt and decrypt as requested.

Basic steps are the following:

- download the src file
- cd ./src
- javac AES.java
- java AES [e/d] keyFile.txt inputFile.txt

where e means encrypt, d means decrypt
